# Schoolwork
A collection of some schoolwork conducted at NTNU since 2017. Note that this does not include all coursework I have done, but rather a selection of the work that can be useful for others.

Gathered here for two reasons:
1. To give myself an overview of courses I have had, so I know where too look for previous work.
2. To provide others NTNU students with some (possibly needed) guidance on how to do their work.

All work included in this repo (and in general all work posted publicly on my Github) is uploaded as is. I can not guarantee that the work is fully correct, although I have passed all courses included here. Some assignments were not fully completed, mostly due to time constraints, but all work is done to the best of my abilities (at the time).
